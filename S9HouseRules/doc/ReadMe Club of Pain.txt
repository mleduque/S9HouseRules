INGAME DESCRIPTION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Loviatan priest from the Resting Place of the Whip in Melvaunt created the Barbed Club of Pain to use as an offhand weapon beside his whip. It was used as a reward for an allied Bhaalist assassin who fulfilled a mission for the temple. Since then the Barbed Club of Pain was used for several assassinations and always left distinct marks on the dead, cold bodies. While not efficient for one-hit backstab kills, a successful hit with this club lets victims to be overcome by excessive pain and critical blood loss that can eventually lead to their demise.

In contrast to most other clubs, this weapon is crafted from a simple thin stick. Its slim size and low weight makes the club easy to handle and allows for dangerously precise maneuverability. Numerous metal barbs grew out of the wood, carefully created through the priest's magic and Loviatar's fell blessing. With every strike sharp barbs dig into the victim's flesh, causing extreme pain and even extra damage that continues for some time after the blow.
