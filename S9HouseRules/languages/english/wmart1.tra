@0    = ~Greetings, I am Doluv. I have recently arrived in town. I regularly make the long trek between Athkatla and the ten towns of Icewind Dale with my family to get the most value I can from the items I collect.~
@1    = ~Soon I will be headed to back to Athkatla, the richest city in all of Faer√ªn, to deliver some of the items I have collected. Would you like to take a look at my wares before I go?~
@2    = ~Yes.~
@3    = ~No thanks.~
